Rhythm Reactor is a 3d audio visualiser website that leverages Three.js to create a stunning visual experience that will leave you hypnotized whilst jamming out to your favourite tunes! ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶

This project uses an Icosahedron wireframe mesh alongside GLSL shaders to apply Perlin noise by a magnitude determined by the average frequency of the audio at any given moment. This allows the ball in the center of the screen to morph in response to music!

Additionally, the starry background was also made using Three.js; to create it, I used instanced meshes to create about 3000 randomly scattered particles (so yes, it will create a completely unique starry background every time you refresh!)
